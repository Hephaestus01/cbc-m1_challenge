# Code Refactor Starter Code

The source code files have been refactored to provide better accessibility. This was accomplished in the following ways:
- Additional clarity to the HTML structure by changing <div> elements to more specific tags, including <nav>, <section>, and <article>
- Providing image alt tags. Because these images do not provide additional information beyond the text provided in the corresponding element's section, the alt tags were left as blank, so that screen readers do not call out URL tags, etc.

Additional code optimatizations:
- index.html
    - Added comments to notate different content sections of the page
    - Checked and corrected any broken links

- style.css
    -
